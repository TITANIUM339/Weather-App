# Weather-App

A Weather-App built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

You can search for zip-code, city name, country name etc and get the weather information of that location.

The search bar has autocomplete.

This app is bundled using webpack and uses Bootstrap icons, ESlint, Prettier, the date-fns library, and fetches the weather data from an API.
